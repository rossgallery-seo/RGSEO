Their petals, delicate yet resilient, would last for weeks.Together, we’d journey from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara in search of rare orchid varieties—epiphytic treasures and exotic bulbs—to enrich her ever-growing garden. Our trips became rituals of beauty, discovery, and time shared.A graceful spray of orchids rested on her kitchen table the day she passed. That arrangement remains preserved, still in bloom, lovingly shadow-boxed as a tribute. Her legacy—dozens of extraordinary orchids—passed from her garden to my mother and now to me. Orchids are more than flowers; they envelop memory and lineage, grace and endurance. They embody the quiet strength of the women who shaped me. Like them, orchids endure—timeless, poised, and never in a hurry to fade.</p></div></section></div>"
